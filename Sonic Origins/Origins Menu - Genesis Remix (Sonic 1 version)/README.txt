Overview

This is a bonus add-on mod that's meant to accompany "The Ultimate Genesis Remix Overhaul (Sonic 1)". I made it separate not only to make it optional, but also to help with any compatibility issues with other mods that modify the HITE_music ACB/AWB files.

v1.0.1
-Added this README.txt file to the mod's install folder.

v1.0

Installation Instructions

If you're reading this, chances are HedgeModManager has already installed the mod, but if not, place the mod.ini and the accompanying folder in its own folder, and open that with HedgeModManager. (In other words, all of these files, and these files ONLY, should be in a folder. Open that folder in HedgeModManager.)
