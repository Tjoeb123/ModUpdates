Overview

This mod replaces certain songs from Sonic 2 with a selection of Genesis remixes of songs from other games. A grab bag of Genesis remixes, if you will. The full list of songs and what they replace can be found on GameBanana.com.

Installation Instructions

If you're reading this, chances are HedgeModManager has already installed the mod, but if not, place the mod.ini and the accompanying folder in its own folder, and open that with HedgeModManager. (In other words, all of these files, and these files ONLY, should be in a folder. Open that folder in HedgeModManager.)
