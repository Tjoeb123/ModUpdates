## Version 1.3

- In light of Nintendo's recent DMCA takedowns of mods for Garry's Mod, and to get ahead of something similar potentially happening to GameBananna as a whole, the Star Light theme is now replaced by "Living in the City" from Sonic R (as a Genesis remix, of course) instead of Rainbow Road N64.
- As a result, all previous instances of this mod have been removed from the site.
- If you have those versions already downloaded, you can continue to use them if you choose not to update.

## Version 1.2.1

- Fixed a critical typo in the mod_files.txt file that prevented the AWB file from actually updating

## Version 1.2

- Updated the drums track for "Back in Time" to be closer to the original arrangement.
- Added the intro to "Work it Out".

## The Ultimate Genesis Remix Overhaul (Sonic 1) v1.1

- Updated the sound mixing for "Theory of Attack" to make the drums a bit less obnoxious in spots.
- Added the two-cymbal into to "Theory of Attack".
- "Continue" no longer loops. It instead fades out.

## The Ultimate Genesis Remix Overhaul (Sonic 1) v1.0.1

- Added a README.txt file to the mod's install folder.


## The Ultimate Genesis Remix Overhaul (Sonic 1) v1.0
